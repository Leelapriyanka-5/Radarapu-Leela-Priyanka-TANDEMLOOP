PYTHON PROGRAMMING

INSTALL IDE(Integration Development Environment) on System or Visual Studio Code.
Add setup to it and give permissions to it.
Now you can run the programs.

Program1:
#Calculator Program
I have taken three parameters in constructor i.e. 2 values and one is for operation purpose so it is taken as string .for the reference purpose i taken self and i used built in String operation lower() to convert input into lower.
next i take user defined function and performed all the operations.
Later created object for class and stored that result in one object and called the method with object.and finally printed the result.

Program2:
#Generating odd series
created function.created an empty list and num intialized as 1.
taken for loop range from 1ton and that number appended to list.
and num value incremented by 2.and created object for it and function called and printed series using join and map.

Program3
#Generating Series
taken n as input.if n divisible with 2 the n reduces to 1
taken forloop for reducing to odd values and printing the result using join and map.

Program4
#Counting Multiples
Taking input_list as input.creating empty dictionary.taking forloop range from 1to10 that prints from 1to9.count initialized as 0.and again for loop to iterate values in list and if that value is divisible by range value then count increments +1 and prints result.
